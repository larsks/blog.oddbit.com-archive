    <summary type="html">Update 2019-05-09 Pull request #55816 has merged, so you can now use sudo with the docker connection driver even when sudo is configured to require a password.
 I often use Docker to test out Ansible playbooks. While normally that works great, I recently ran into an unexpected problem with privilege escalation. Given a simple playbook like this:

    <summary type="html">I often see questions from people who are attemping to perform complex text transformations in their Ansible playbooks. While I am a huge fan of Ansible, data transformation is not one of its strong points. For example, this past week someone asked a question on Stack Overflow in which they were attempting to convert the output of the keytool command into a list of dictionaries. The output of the keytool -list -v command looks something like this:</summary>

    <summary type="html">Bitwarden is a password management service (like LastPass or 1Password). It&amp;rsquo;s unique in that it is built entirely on open source software. In addition to the the web UI and mobile apps that you would expect, Bitwarden also provides a command-line tool for interacting with the your password store.
At $WORK(-ish) we&amp;rsquo;re looking into Bitwarden because we want a password sharing and management solution that was better than dropping files into directories on remote hosts or sharing things over Slack.</summary>

Ansible already has a chroot module, of course, but for some situations &amp;ndash; such as targeting an emulated chroot environment &amp;ndash; that just means a lot of extra work.</summary>

I&amp;rsquo;ve just submitted pull request #14359 to Ansible which implements support for folding long lines using the INI-format convention of using indent to mark extended logical lines.</summary>

I&amp;rsquo;ve thrown together a quick wrapper that will allow you (and me!) to do exactly that, called ansible-role. The --help output looks like this:
usage: ansible-role [-h] [--verbose] [--gather] [--no-gather] [--extra-vars EXTRA_VARS] [-i INVENTORY] [--hosts HOSTS] [--sudo] [--become] [--user USER] role positional arguments: role optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --verbose, -v --gather, -g --no-gather, -G --extra-vars EXTRA_VARS, -e EXTRA_VARS Inventory: -i INVENTORY, --inventory INVENTORY --hosts HOSTS, -H HOSTS Identity: --sudo, -s --become, -b --user USER, -u USER  Example If you have a role roles/testrole that contains the following in tasks/main.</summary>

A &amp;ldquo;connection driver&amp;rdquo; is the mechanism by which Ansible connects to your target hosts. These days it uses ssh by default (which relies on the OpenSSH command line client for connectivity), and it also offers the Paramiko library as an alternative ssh implementation (this was in fact the default driver in earlier versions of Ansible).</summary>
