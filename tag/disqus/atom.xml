    <summary type="html">As long as I&amp;rsquo;m switching site generators, it seems like a good idea to refresh the comment system as well. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Disqus for a while, since when I started it was one of the only games in town. There are now alternatives of different sorts, and one in particular caught my eye: Utterances uses GitHub issues for storing comments, which seems like a fantastic idea.
That means that comments will finally be stored in the same place as the blog content, which I think is a happy state of affairs.</summary>
