      <description>I like to fiddle with Micropython, particularly on the Wemos D1 Mini, because these are such a neat form factor. Unfortunately, they have a cheap CH340 serial adapter on board, which means that from the perspective of Linux these devices are all functionally identical &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s no way to identify one device from another. This by itself would be a manageable problem, except that the device names assigned to these devices aren&amp;rsquo;t constant: depending on the order in which they get plugged in (and the order in which they are detected at boot), a device might be /dev/ttyUSB0 one day and /dev/ttyUSB2 another day.</description>
