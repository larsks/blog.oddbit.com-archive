      <description>This articles describes how I got CrashPlan running on my FreeBSD 8(-STABLE) system. These instructions by Kim Scarborough were my starting point, but as these were for FreeBSD 7 there were some additional steps necessary to get things working.
Install Java I had originally thought that it might be possible to run the CrashPlan client &amp;ldquo;natively&amp;rdquo; under FreeBSD. CrashPlan is a Java application, so this seemed like a possible solution. Unfortunately, Java under FreeBSD 8 seems to be a lost cause.</description>
