      <description>I recently set up a git repository server (using gitosis and gitweb). Among the required features of the system was the ability to publish the git repository to a read-only Subversion repository. This sounds simple in principle but in practice proved to be a bit tricky.

What we want to do is move a project from a path that looks like this:
.../projects/some-project-name  To a new repository using the recommended Subversion repository layout, like this:</description>
