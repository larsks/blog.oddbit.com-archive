      <description>legendre on #raspbian asked:
 How can i config rasp lite to open a shell on the serial uart on boot? Params are 1200-8-N-1 Dont want login running, just straight to sh
 The process is fairly simple. First, you need to ensure you have a functional serial port. If you&#39;re on a Raspberry Pi 3 (or later), you may need to explicitly enable the serial port by adding enable_uart=1 to /boot/config.</description>

      <description>The DS18B20 is a popular temperature sensor that uses the 1-Wire protocol for communication. Recent versions of the Linux kernel include a kernel driver for this protocol, making it relatively convenient to connect one or more of these devices to a Raspberry Pi or similar device. 1-Wire devices can be daisy chained, so it is possible to connect several devices to your Pi using only a single GPIO pin, and you&#39;ll find many articles out there that describe how to do so.</description>
