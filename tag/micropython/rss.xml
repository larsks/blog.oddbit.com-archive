      <description>I like to fiddle with Micropython, particularly on the Wemos D1 Mini, because these are such a neat form factor. Unfortunately, they have a cheap CH340 serial adapter on board, which means that from the perspective of Linux these devices are all functionally identical &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s no way to identify one device from another. This by itself would be a manageable problem, except that the device names assigned to these devices aren&amp;rsquo;t constant: depending on the order in which they get plugged in (and the order in which they are detected at boot), a device might be /dev/ttyUSB0 one day and /dev/ttyUSB2 another day.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a couple of sensors attached to an ESP8266 running MicroPython. You&amp;rsquo;d like to sample them at different frequencies (say, one every 60 seconds and one every five minutes), and you&amp;rsquo;d like to do it as efficiently as possible in terms of power consumption. What are your options?
If we don&amp;rsquo;t care about power efficiency, the simplest solution is probably a loop like this:
import machine lastrun_1 = 0 lastrun_2 = 0 while True: now = time.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re all looking for ways to keep ourselves occupied these days, and for me that means leaping at the chance to turn a small problem into a slightly ridiculous electronics project. For reasons that I won&amp;rsquo;t go into here I wanted to generate an alert when a certain WiFi BSSID becomes visible. A simple solution to this problem would have been a few lines of shell script to send me an email&amp;hellip;but this article isn&amp;rsquo;t about simple solutions!</description>

      <title>Using a TM1637 LED module with CircuitPython</title>

      <description>CircuitPython is &amp;ldquo;an education friendly open source derivative of MicroPython&amp;rdquo;. MicroPython is a port of Python to microcontroller environments; it can run on boards with very few resources such as the ESP8266. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started experimenting with CircuitPython on a Wemos D1 mini, which is a small form-factor ESP8266 board.
I had previously been using Mike Causer&amp;rsquo;s micropython-tm1637 for MicroPython to drive a 4 digit LED display. I was hoping to get the same code working under CircuitPython, but when I tried to build an image that included the tm1637 module I ran into:</description>
