    <summary type="html">We&#39;re all looking for ways to keep ourselves occupied these days, and for me that means leaping at the chance to turn a small problem into a slightly ridiculous electronics project. For reasons that I won&#39;t go into here I wanted to generate an alert when a certain WiFi BSSID becomes visible. A simple solution to this problem would have been a few lines of shell script to send me an email&amp;hellip;but this article isn&#39;t about simple solutions!</summary>

    <summary type="html">We&#39;ve had some wacky weather recently. In the space of a week, the temperature went from a high of about 75°F to a low around 15°F. This got me to thinking about what constitutes &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; weather here in the Boston area, and in particular, how common it is to have a string of consecutive days in which the high temperature stays below freezing. While this was an interesting question in itself, it also seemed like a great opportunity to learn a little about Pandas, the Python data analysis framework.</summary>

    <summary type="html">I recently answered a question from Harsha Nalore on StackOverflow that involved using Ansible to extract the output of a command sent to a BigIP device of some sort. My solution &amp;ndash; which I claim to be functional, but probably not optimal &amp;ndash; involved writing an Ansible filter module to parse the output. That filter made use of a complex-looking regular expression. Harsha asked for some details on that regular expression works, and the existing StackOverflow answer didn&#39;t really seem the write place for that: so, here we are.</summary>

    <summary type="html">I often see questions from people who are attemping to perform complex text transformations in their Ansible playbooks. While I am a huge fan of Ansible, data transformation is not one of its strong points. For example, this past week someone asked a question on Stack Overflow in which they were attempting to convert the output of the keytool command into a list of dictionaries. The output of the keytool -list -v command looks something like this:</summary>

    <summary type="html">CircuitPython is &amp;ldquo;an education friendly open source derivative of MicroPython&amp;quot;. MicroPython is a port of Python to microcontroller environments; it can run on boards with very few resources such as the ESP8266. I&#39;ve recently started experimenting with CircuitPython on a Wemos D1 mini, which is a small form-factor ESP8266 board.
I had previously been using Mike Causer&#39;s micropython-tm1637 for MicroPython to drive a 4 digit LED display. I was hoping to get the same code working under CircuitPython, but when I tried to build an image that included the tm1637 module I ran into:</summary>

    <title>A Python interface to signalfd() using FFI</title>

    <summary type="html">I just recently learned about the signalfd(2) system call, which was introduced to the Linux kernel back in 2007:
 signalfd() creates a file descriptor that can be used to accept signals targeted at the caller. This provides an alternative to the use of a signal handler or sigwaitinfo(2), and has the advantage that the file descriptor may be monitored by select(2), poll(2), and epoll(7).
 The traditional asynchronous delivery mechanism can be tricky to get right, whereas this provides a convenient fd interface that integrates nicely with your existing event-based code.</summary>

My pubsub_example repository on GitHub has a complete project that implements the ideas discussed in this article. This project can be deployed directly on OpenShift if you want to try things out on your own. You can also try it out online at http://pubsub.</summary>

    <summary type="html">I recently acquired both a Raspberry Pi and a PiFace IO board. I had a rough time finding examples of how to read the input ports via interrupts (rather than periodically polling for values), especially for the newer versions of the PiFace python libraries.
After a little research, here&#39;s some simple code that will print out pin names as you press the input buttons. Button 3 will cause the code to exit:</summary>

    <summary type="html">I just learned about the Python ctypes module, which is a Python module for interfacing with C code. Among other things, ctypes lets you call arbitrary functions in shared libraries. This is, from my perspective, some very cool magic. I thought I would provide a short example here, since it took me a little time to get everything working smoothly.
For this example, we&#39;ll write a wrapper for the standard statvfs(2) function:</summary>
