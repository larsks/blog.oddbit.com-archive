    <summary type="html">I find myself working with Raspbian disk images fairly often. A typical workflow is:
 Download the disk image. Mount the filesystem somewhere to check something. Make some changes or install packages just to check something else. Crap I&#39;ve made changes.  &amp;hellip;at which point I need to fetch a new copy of the image next time I want to start fresh.
Sure, I could just make a copy of the image and work from there, but what fun is that?</summary>
