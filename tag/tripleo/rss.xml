      <description>In this article, we will look at what is necessary to run OpenStack&amp;rsquo;s Keystone service (and the requisite database server) in containers using Docker Compose.
Running MariaDB The standard mariadb docker image can be configured via a number of environment variables. It also benefits from persistent volume storage, since in most situations you don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose your data when you remove a container. A simple docker command line for starting MariaDB might look something like:</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you have set up an environment using tripleo-quickstart and you would like to add another virtual machine to the mix that has both &amp;ldquo;external&amp;rdquo; connectivity (&amp;ldquo;external&amp;rdquo; in quotes because I am using it in the same way as the quickstart does w/r/t the undercloud) and connectivity to the overcloud nodes. How would you go about setting that up?
For a concrete example, let&amp;rsquo;s presume you have deployed an environment using the default tripleo-quickstart configuration, which looks like this:</description>

      <description>In this article I would like to introduce tripleo-quickstart, a tool that will automatically provision a virtual environment and then use TripleO to deploy an HA OpenStack on top of it.
Introducing Tripleo-Quickstart The goal of the Tripleo-Quickstart project is to replace the instack-virt-setup tool for quickly setting up virtual TripleO environments, and to ultimately become the tool used by both developers and upstream CI for this purpose. The project is a set of Ansible playbooks that will take care of:</description>
