      <description>systemd-nspawn has been called &amp;ldquo;chroot on steroids&amp;rdquo;, but if you think of it as Docker with a slightly different target you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be far wrong, either. It can be used to spawn containers on your host, and has a variety of options for configuring the containerized environment through the use of private networking, bind mounts, capability controls, and a variety of other facilities that give you flexible container management.</description>
