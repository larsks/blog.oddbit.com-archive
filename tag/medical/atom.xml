Disclaimer: I am not an expert, just a private individual summarizing available information. Please correct me if I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten something wrong.
TL;DR   I suggest: (a) the Vog valveless mask or (b) the O2 Canada Curve Respirator. If (b), make sure you cut some an extra filter into two small circles and put the material in the respirator to cover the exhale valves.</summary>

    <summary type="html">A year or so ago I was diagnosed with sleep apnea, and since them I&amp;rsquo;ve been sleeping with a CPAP. This past weekend, I joined my daughter on a scout camping trip to a campground without readily accessible electricity. This would be the first time I found myself in this situation, and as the date approached, I realized I was going to have to build or buy some sort of battery solution for my CPAP.</summary>
