      <description>We&#39;ve had some wacky weather recently. In the space of a week, the temperature went from a high of about 75°F to a low around 15°F. This got me to thinking about what constitutes &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; weather here in the Boston area, and in particular, how common it is to have a string of consecutive days in which the high temperature stays below freezing. While this was an interesting question in itself, it also seemed like a great opportunity to learn a little about Pandas, the Python data analysis framework.</description>
