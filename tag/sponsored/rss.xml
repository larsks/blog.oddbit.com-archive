      <description>The folks at Seeed Studio have just released the Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino, and they asked if I would be willing to take a look at it in exchange for a free kit. At first glance it reminds me of the Radio Shack (remember when they were cool?) electronics kit I had when I was a kid &amp;ndash; but somewhat more advanced. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to take a closer look, but given shipping these days means it&amp;rsquo;s probably a month away at least.</description>
