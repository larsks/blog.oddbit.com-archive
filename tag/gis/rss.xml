      <description>If you should find yourself wanting to install pyspatialite on Fedora &amp;ndash; perhaps because you want to use the Processing plugin for QGIS &amp;ndash; you will first need to install the following dependencies:
 gcc python-devel sqlite-devel geos-devel proj-devel python-pip redhat-rpm-config  After which you can install pyspatialite using pip by running:
CFLAGS=-I/usr/include pip install pyspatialite  At this point, you should be able to use the &amp;ldquo;Processing&amp;rdquo; plugin.</description>
