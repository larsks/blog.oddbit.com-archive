      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re all looking for ways to keep ourselves occupied these days, and for me that means leaping at the chance to turn a small problem into a slightly ridiculous electronics project. For reasons that I won&amp;rsquo;t go into here I wanted to generate an alert when a certain WiFi BSSID becomes visible. A simple solution to this problem would have been a few lines of shell script to send me an email&amp;hellip;but this article isn&amp;rsquo;t about simple solutions!</description>

      <description>CircuitPython is &amp;ldquo;an education friendly open source derivative of MicroPython&amp;rdquo;. MicroPython is a port of Python to microcontroller environments; it can run on boards with very few resources such as the ESP8266. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started experimenting with CircuitPython on a Wemos D1 mini, which is a small form-factor ESP8266 board.
I had previously been using Mike Causer&amp;rsquo;s micropython-tm1637 for MicroPython to drive a 4 digit LED display. I was hoping to get the same code working under CircuitPython, but when I tried to build an image that included the tm1637 module I ran into:</description>
