      <description>This is part of a series of posts about my experience working with OpenShift and CNV. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll look at how the recently released CNV 2.4 resolves some issues in managing virtual machines that are attached directly to local layer 2 networks
In [an earlier post][part 2] of this series, I discussed some issues around the management of virtual machine MAC addresses in CNV 2.3: in particular, that virtual machines are assigned a random MAC address not just at creation time but every time they boot.</description>

      <description>This is the second in a series of posts about my experience working with OpenShift and CNV. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking a look at how to expose services on a virtual machine once you&amp;rsquo;ve git it up and running.
 TL;DR Overview Connectivity options Direct attachment Using an OpenShift Service  Exposing services on NodePorts Exposing services on cluster external IPso Exposing services using a LoadBalancer     TL;DR Networking seems to be a weak area for CNV right now.</description>

      <description>This is the first in a series of posts about my experience working with OpenShift and CNV (&amp;ldquo;Container Native Virtualization&amp;rdquo;, a technology that allows you to use OpenShift to manage virtualized workloads in addition to the containerized workloads for which OpenShift is known). In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking a look at the installation experience, and in particular at how restrictions in our local environment interacted with the network requirements of the installer.</description>
