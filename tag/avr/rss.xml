      <description>Say you have a simple bit of code:
#include &amp;lt;avr/io.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;util/delay.h&amp;gt; #define LED_BUILTIN _BV(PORTB5) int main(void) { DDRB |= LED_BUILTIN; while (1) { PORTB |= LED_BUILTIN; // turn on led _delay_ms(1000); // delay 1s PORTB &amp;amp;= ~LED_BUILTIN; // turn off led _delay_ms(1000); // delay 1s } }  You have a Makefile that compiles that into an object (.o) file like this:
avr-gcc -mmcu=atmega328p -DF_CPU=16000000 -Os -c blink.c  If you were to forget to set the device type when compiling your .</description>

      <title>ATOMIC_BLOCK magic in avr-libc</title>

      <description>The AVR C library, avr-libc, provide an ATOMIC_BLOCK macro that you can use to wrap critical sections of your code to ensure that interrupts are disabled while the code executes. At high level, the ATOMIC_BLOCK macro (when called using ATOMIC_FORCEON) does something like this:
cli(); ...your code here... seti();  But it&amp;rsquo;s more than that. If you read the documentation for the macro, it says:
 Creates a block of code that is guaranteed to be executed atomically.</description>

      <description>How big is an enum? I noticed something odd while browsing through the assembly output of some AVR C code I wrote recently. In the code, I have the following expression:
int main() { setup(); while (state != STATE_QUIT) { loop(); } }  Here, state is a variable of type enum STATE, which looks something like this (not exactly like this; there are actually 19 possible values but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to clutter this post with unnecessary code listings):</description>

      <title>AVR micro-optimization: Losing malloc</title>

      <description>Pssst! Hey&amp;hellip;hey, buddy, wanna get an extra KB for cheap?
When I write OO-style code in C, I usually start with something like the following, in which I use malloc() to allocate memory for a variable of a particular type, perform some initialization actions, and then return it to the caller:
Button *button_new(uint8_t pin, uint8_t poll_freq) { Button *button = (Button *)malloc(sizeof(Button)); // do some initialization stuff return button; }  And when initially writing pipower, that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I did.</description>

      <description>In a case of awful timing, after my recent project involving some attiny85 programming I finally got around to learning how to use simavr and gdb to help debug my AVR code. It was too late for me (and I will never get the time back that I spent debugging things with an LED and lots of re-flashing), but maybe this will help someone else!
I&amp;rsquo;ve split this into three posts:</description>

      <description>This is the second of three posts about using gdb and simavr to debug AVR code. The complete series is:
  Part 1: Using GDB
A walkthrough of using GDB to manually inspect the behavior of our code.
  Part 2: Automating GDB with scripts
Creating GDB scripts to automatically test the behavior of our code.
  Part 3: Tracing with simavr
Using simavr to collect information about the state of microcontroller pins while our code is running.</description>
