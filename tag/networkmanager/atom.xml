    <summary type="html">My internet service provider (FIOS) doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet (sad face) offer IPv6 capable service, so I&amp;rsquo;ve set up an IPv6 tunnel using the Hurricane Electric tunnel broker. I want to provide IPv6 connectivity to multiple systems in my house, but not to all systems in my house 1. In order to meet those requirements, I&amp;rsquo;m going to set up the tunnel on the router, and then expose connectivity over an IPv6-only VLAN.</summary>

    <summary type="html">I recently acquired a managed switch for my home office in order to segment a few devices off onto their own isolated vlan. As part of this, I want to expose these vlans on my desktop using Open vSwitch (OVS), and I wanted to implement the configuration using NetworkManager rather than either relying on the legacy /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts scripts or rolling my own set of services. These are my notes in case I ever have to do this again.</summary>

    <summary type="html">These are my notes on making OpenStack play well with firewalld and NetworkManager.
NetworkManager By default, NetworkManager attempts to start a DHCP client on every new available interface. Since booting a single instance in OpenStack can result in the creation of several virtual interfaces, this results in a lot of:
