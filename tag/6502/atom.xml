    <summary type="html">The SYM-1 is a 6502-based single-board computer produced by Synertek Systems Corp in the mid 1970&amp;rsquo;s. I&amp;rsquo;ve had one floating around in a box for many, many years, and after a recent foray into the world of 6502 assembly language programming I decided to pull it out, dust it off, and see if it still works.
The board I have has a whopping 8KB of memory, and in addition to the standard SUPERMON monitor it has the expansion ROMs for the Synertek BASIC interpreter (yet another Microsoft BASIC) and RAE (the &amp;ldquo;Resident Assembler Editor&amp;rdquo;).</summary>
