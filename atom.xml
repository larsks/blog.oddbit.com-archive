    <summary type="html">This is part of a series of posts about my experience working with OpenShift and CNV. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll look at how the recently released CNV 2.4 resolves some issues in managing virtual machines that are attached directly to local layer 2 networks
In an earlier post, I discussed some issues around the management of virtual machine MAC addresses in CNV 2.3: in particular, that virtual machines are assigned a random MAC address not just at creation time but every time they boot.</summary>

The Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino (henceforth &amp;ldquo;the Kit&amp;rdquo;, because ain&amp;rsquo;t nobody got time to type that out more than a few times in a single article) is about 8.5 x 5 x 1 inches. Closed, you could fit two of them on a piece of 8.</summary>

    <summary type="html">The folks at Seeed Studio have just released the Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino, and they asked if I would be willing to take a look at it in exchange for a free kit. At first glance it reminds me of the Radio Shack (remember when they were cool?) electronics kit I had when I was a kid &amp;ndash; but somewhat more advanced. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to take a closer look, but given shipping these days means it&amp;rsquo;s probably a month away at least.</summary>

 How can i config rasp lite to open a shell on the serial uart on boot? Params are 1200-8-N-1 Dont want login running, just straight to sh
 In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through one way of implementing this configuration.
Activate the serial port Raspbian automatically starts a getty on the serial port if one is available. You should see an agetty process associated with your serial port when you run ps -ef.</summary>

As part of this, I want to expose these vlans on my desktop using Open vSwitch (OVS), and I wanted to implement the configuration using NetworkManager rather than either relying on the legacy /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts scripts or rolling my own set of services.

    <summary type="html">We&amp;rsquo;ve had some wacky weather recently. In the space of a week, the temperature went from a high of about 75°F to a low around 15°F. This got me to thinking about what constitutes &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; weather here in the Boston area, and in particular, how common it is to have a string of consecutive days in which the high temperature stays below freezing. While this was an interesting question in itself, it also seemed like a great opportunity to learn a little about Pandas, the Python data analysis framework.</summary>

    <summary type="html">Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is combined with its documentation to form a single document. Tools are then used to extract the documentation for viewing or typesetting or to extract the program code so it can be compiled and/or run. While I have never been very enthusiastic about literate programming as a development methodology, I was recently inspired to explore these ideas as they relate to the sort of technical writing I do for this blog.</summary>

That served as an excellent reference for a number of years, but if you&amp;rsquo;ve deployed a recent version of OpenStack you may have noticed that the network architecture looks completely different. The network namespaces previously used to implement routers and dhcp servers are gone (along with iptables rules and other features), and have been replaced by OVN (&amp;ldquo;Open Virtual Network&amp;rdquo;).</summary>
