    <summary type="html">Out of the box, OpenShift (4.x) on bare metal doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with any integrated load balancer support (when installed in a cloud environment, OpenShift typically makes use of the load balancing features available from the cloud provider). Fortunately, there are third party solutions available that are designed to work in bare metal environments. MetalLB is a popular choice, but requires some minor fiddling to get it to run properly on OpenShift.</summary>

    <summary type="html">I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eye on the Vortex Core keyboard for a few months now, and this past week I finally broke down and bought one (with Cherry MX Brown switches). The Vortex Core is a 40% keyboard, which means it consists primarily of letter keys, a few lonely bits of punctuation, and several modifier keys to activate different layers on the keyboard.
  Physical impressions It&amp;rsquo;s a really cute keyboard.</summary>

    <summary type="html">At work we have a cluster of IBM Power 9 systems running OpenShift. The problem with this environment is that nobody runs Power 9 on their desktop, and Docker Hub only offers automatic build support for the x86 architecture. This means there&amp;rsquo;s no convenient options for building Power 9 Docker images&amp;hellip;or so I thought.
It turns out that Docker provides GitHub actions that make the process of producing multi-architecture images quite simple.</summary>

    <summary type="html">This is part of a series of posts about my experience working with OpenShift and CNV. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll look at how the recently released CNV 2.4 resolves some issues in managing virtual machines that are attached directly to local layer 2 networks
In an earlier post, I discussed some issues around the management of virtual machine MAC addresses in CNV 2.3: in particular, that virtual machines are assigned a random MAC address not just at creation time but every time they boot.</summary>

    <summary type="html">The folks at Seeed Studio have just released the Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino, and they asked if I would be willing to take a look at it in exchange for a free kit. At first glance it reminds me of the Radio Shack (remember when they were cool?) electronics kit I had when I was a kid &amp;ndash; but somewhat more advanced. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to take a closer look, but given shipping these days means it&amp;rsquo;s probably a month away at least.</summary>

 How can i config rasp lite to open a shell on the serial uart on boot? Params are 1200-8-N-1 Dont want login running, just straight to sh
 In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through one way of implementing this configuration.
Activate the serial port Raspbian automatically starts a getty on the serial port if one is available. You should see an agetty process associated with your serial port when you run ps -ef.</summary>

This got me to thinking about what constitutes &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; weather here in the Boston area, and in particular, how common it is to have a string of consecutive days in which the high temperature stays below freezing. While this was an interesting question in itself, it also seemed like a great opportunity to learn a little about Pandas, the Python data analysis framework.</summary>

    <summary type="html">Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is combined with its documentation to form a single document. Tools are then used to extract the documentation for viewing or typesetting or to extract the program code so it can be compiled and/or run. While I have never been very enthusiastic about literate programming as a development methodology, I was recently inspired to explore these ideas as they relate to the sort of technical writing I do for this blog.</summary>
