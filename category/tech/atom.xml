  I thought it might be interesting to walk through the process I used to create the video. The steps described in this article aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly what I used (I was dealing with data in a PostGIS database, and in the interests of simplicity I wanted instructions that can be accomplished with just QGIS), but they end up in the same place.</summary>

    <summary type="html">Out of the box, OpenShift (4.x) on bare metal doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with any integrated load balancer support (when installed in a cloud environment, OpenShift typically makes use of the load balancing features available from the cloud provider). Fortunately, there are third party solutions available that are designed to work in bare metal environments. MetalLB is a popular choice, but requires some minor fiddling to get it to run properly on OpenShift.</summary>

The Vortex Core is a 40% keyboard, which means it consists primarily of letter keys, a few lonely bits of punctuation, and several modifier keys to activate different layers on the keyboard.
  Physical impressions It&amp;rsquo;s a really cute keyboard.</summary>

    <summary type="html">At work we have a cluster of IBM Power 9 systems running OpenShift. The problem with this environment is that nobody runs Power 9 on their desktop, and Docker Hub only offers automatic build support for the x86 architecture. This means there&amp;rsquo;s no convenient options for building Power 9 Docker images&amp;hellip;or so I thought.
It turns out that Docker provides GitHub actions that make the process of producing multi-architecture images quite simple.</summary>

In an earlier post, I discussed some issues around the management of virtual machine MAC addresses in CNV 2.3: in particular, that virtual machines are assigned a random MAC address not just at creation time but every time they boot.</summary>

Activate the serial port Raspbian automatically starts a getty on the serial port if one is available. You should see an agetty process associated with your serial port when you run ps -ef.</summary>
