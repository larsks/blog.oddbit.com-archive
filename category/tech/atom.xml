    <summary type="html">OpenShift Container Storage (OCS) from Red Hat deploys Ceph in your OpenShift cluster (or allows you to integrate with an external Ceph cluster). In addition to the file- and block- based volume services provided by Ceph, OCS includes two S3-api compatible object storage implementations.
The first option is the Ceph Object Gateway (radosgw), Ceph&amp;rsquo;s native object storage interface. The second option called the &amp;ldquo;Multicloud Object Gateway&amp;rdquo;, which is in fact a piece of software named Noobaa, a storage abstraction layer that was acquired by Red Hat in 2018.</summary>

    <summary type="html">Performance of the primary PyPi service has been so bad lately that it&amp;rsquo;s become very disruptive. Tasks that used to take a few seconds will now churn along for 15-20 minutes or longer before completing, which is incredibly frustrating.
I first went looking to see if there was a PyPi mirror infrastructure, like we see with CPAN for Perl or CTAN for Tex (and similarly for most Linux distributions). There is apparently no such beast,</summary>

You&amp;rsquo;d like to sample them at different frequencies (say, one every 60 seconds and one every five minutes), and you&amp;rsquo;d like to do it as efficiently as possible in terms of power consumption. What are your options?
If we don&amp;rsquo;t care about power efficiency, the simplest solution is probably a loop like this:

The problem with this environment is that nobody runs Power 9 on their desktop, and Docker Hub only offers automatic build support for the x86 architecture. This means there&amp;rsquo;s no convenient options for building Power 9 Docker images&amp;hellip;or so I thought.
It turns out that Docker provides GitHub actions that make the process of producing multi-architecture images quite simple.</summary>
