      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about logging in the context of OpenStack and containerized service deployments. I&amp;rsquo;d like to lay out some of my thoughts on this topic and see if people think I am talking crazy or not.
There are effectively three different mechanisms that an application can use to emit log messages:
 Via some logging-specific API, such as the legacy syslog API By writing a byte stream to stdout/stderr By writing a byte stream to a file  A substantial advantage to the first mechanism (using a logging API) is that the application is logging messages rather than bytes.</description>

      <description>As part of a project I&amp;rsquo;m working on I wanted to get a rough idea of the activity of the Apache virtual hosts on the system. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find exactly what I wanted, so I refreshed my memory of curses to bring you vhoststats.
This tools reads an Apache log file (with support for arbitrary formats) and generates a dynamic bar chart showing the activity (in number of requests and bytes transferred) of hosts on the system.</description>
