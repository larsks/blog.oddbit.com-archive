    <summary>I recently added some scripts to automatically generate tag feeds for my blog when pushing new content. I&amp;rsquo;m using GitHub Pages to publish everything, so it seemed easiest to make tag generation part of a pre-push hook (new in Git 1.8.2). This hook is run automatically as part of the git push operation, so it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect place to insert generated content that must be kept in sync with posts on the blog.</summary>

    <summary>I&amp;rsquo;ve enabled blog comments using Disqus. This is something of an experiment, since (a) I&amp;rsquo;m not really happy with how Disqus is handling user registration these days and (b) I don&amp;rsquo;t know that I have the time to moderate anything. But we&amp;rsquo;ll see.</summary>

    <summary>This blog has been hosted on scriptogram for the past year or so. Unfortunately, while I like the publish-via-Dropbox mechanism, there have been enough problems recently that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally switched over to using GitHub Pages for hosting. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about doing this for a while, but the things that finally pushed me to make the change were:
 Sync problems that would prevent new posts from appearing (and that at least once caused posts to disappear).</summary>
