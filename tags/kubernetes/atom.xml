    <summary type="html">Next week is the Red Hat Summit in Boston, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking part in a Project Atomic presentation in which I will discuss various (well, two) options for deploying Atomic into an OpenStack environment, focusing on my heat-kubernetes templates.
As part of that presentation, I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a short demonstration video:
 This shows off the autoscaling behavior available with recent versions of these templates (and also serves as a very brief introduction to working with Kubernetes).</summary>

    <summary type="html">I have recently started running some &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; services (that is, &amp;ldquo;services being consumed by someone other than myself&amp;rdquo;) on top of Kubernetes (running on bare metal), which means I suddenly had to confront the question of how to provide external access to Kubernetes hosted services. Kubernetes provides two solutions to this problem, neither of which is particularly attractive out of the box:
 There is a field createExternalLoadBalancer that can be set in a service description.</summary>

    <summary type="html">I have recently been doing some work with Kubernetes, and wanted to put together a minimal image with which I could test service and pod deployment. Size in this case was critical: I wanted something that would download quickly when initially deployed, because I am often setting up and tearing down Kubernetes as part of my testing (and some of my test environments have poor external bandwidth).

    <summary type="html">While experimenting with Fedora Atomic, I was looking for an elegant way to automatically deploy Atomic into an OpenStack environment and then automatically schedule some Docker containers on the Atomic host. This post describes my solution.
Like many other cloud-targeted distributions, Fedora Atomic runs cloud-init when the system boots. We can take advantage of this to configure the system at first boot by providing a user-data blob to Nova when we boot the instance.</summary>

    <summary type="html">The current version of Docker has a very limited set of networking options:
 bridge &amp;ndash; connect a container to the Docker bridge host &amp;ndash; run the container in the global network namespace container:xxx &amp;ndash; connect a container to the network namespace of another container none &amp;ndash; do not configure any networking  If you need something more than that, you can use a tool like pipework to provision additional network interfaces inside the container, but this leads to a synchronization problem: pipework can only be used after your container is running.</summary>
