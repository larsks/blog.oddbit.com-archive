    <summary>Alix recently acquired an LG 420G from TracFone. She was interested in getting all of her contacts onto the phone, which at first seemed like a simple task &amp;ndash; transfer a vCard (.vcf) file to the phone via Bluetooth, and the phone would import all the contacts. This turned out to be a great idea in theory, but in practice there was a fatal flaw &amp;ndash; while the phone did indeed import the contacts, it only imported names and the occasional note or email address.</summary>
