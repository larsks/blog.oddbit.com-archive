    <summary>I use CrashPlan as a backup service. It works and is very simple to set up, but has limited options for controlling bandwidth. In fact, if you&amp;rsquo;re running it on a headless system (e.g., a fileserver of some sort), your options are effectively &amp;ldquo;too slow&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;CONSUME EVERYTHING&amp;rdquo;. There is an open request to add time-based limitations to the application itself, but for now I&amp;rsquo;ve solved this using a very simple traffic shaping configuration.</summary>

    <summary>Update: This patch has been accepted into gPXE.
I just released a patch to gPXE that modifies the dhcp command so that it can iterate over multiple interfaces. The stock dhcp command only accepts a single interface as an argument, which can be a problem if you are trying to boot on a machine with multiple interfaces. The builtin autoboot commands attempts to resolve this, but is only useful if you expect to receive appropriate boot parameters from your dhcp server.</summary>

    <summary>VNC clients use the RFB protocol to provide virtual display capabilities. The RFB protocol, as implemented by most clients, provides very poor authentication options. While passwords are not actually sent &amp;ldquo;in the clear&amp;rdquo;, it is possible to brute force them based on information available on the wire. The RFB 3.x protocol limits passwords to a maximum of eight characters, so the potential key space is relatively small.
It&amp;rsquo;s possible to securely connect to a remote VNC server by tunneling your connection using ssh port forwarding (or setting up some sort of SSL proxy).</summary>

    <summary>Like many other folks out there, I have several computers in my house connected to the outside world via a Linux box acting as a NAT gateway. I often want to use application such as BitTorrent and Freenet, which require that a number of ports be forwarded from my external connection to the particular computer on which I happen to be working. It turns out there&amp;rsquo;s a protocol for this, called UPnP.</summary>
