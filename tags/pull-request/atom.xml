    <summary>I often use Docker to test out Ansible playbooks. While normally that works great, I recently ran into an unexpected problem with privilege escalation. Given a simple playbook like this:
--- - hosts: all gather_facts: false become: true tasks: - ping:  And an inventory like this:
all: vars: ansible_user: example ansible_connection: docker hosts: server1: ansible_host: sudostuff_server1_1 server2: ansible_host: sudostuff_server2_1 server3: ansible_host: sudostuff_server3_1  And containers with sudo configured to require a password, Ansible would fail like this (note that I&amp;rsquo;ve configured Ansible to use the debug plugin for stdout_callback):</summary>

    <summary>Bitwarden is a password management service (like LastPass or 1Password). It&amp;rsquo;s unique in that it is built entirely on open source software. In addition to the the web UI and mobile apps that you would expect, Bitwarden also provides a command-line tool for interacting with the your password store.
At $WORK(-ish) we&amp;rsquo;re looking into Bitwarden because we want a password sharing and management solution that was better than dropping files into directories on remote hosts or sharing things over Slack.</summary>

    <summary>I wrote earlier about systemd-nspawn, and how it can take much of the fiddly work out of setting up functional chroot environments. I&amp;rsquo;m a regular Ansible user, and I wanted to be able to apply some of those techniques to my playbooks.
Ansible already has a chroot module, of course, but for some situations &amp;ndash; such as targeting an emulated chroot environment &amp;ndash; that just means a lot of extra work.</summary>

    <title>Folding long lines in Ansible inventory files</title>

    <summary>If you have an Ansible inventory file that includes lots of per host variables, it&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for lines to get long enough that they become unwieldly, particularly if you want to discuss them in an email or write about them in some context (e.g., a blog post).
I&amp;rsquo;ve just submitted pull request #14359 to Ansible which implements support for folding long lines using the INI-format convention of using indent to mark extended logical lines.</summary>

    <summary>This is the second in a loose sequence of articles looking at new features in Ansible 2.0. In the previous article I looked at the Docker connection driver. In this article, I would like to provide an overview of the new-and-much-improved suite of modules for interacting with an OpenStack environment, and provide a few examples of their use.
In versions of Ansible prior to 2.0, there was a small collection of OpenStack modules.</summary>

    <summary>This is a companion to my article on the Docker plugin for Heat.
While writing that article, I encountered a number of bugs in the Docker plugin and elsewhere. I&amp;rsquo;ve submitted patches for most of the issues I encountered:
Bugs in the Heat plugin  https://bugs.launchpad.net/heat/+bug/1364017
docker plugin fails to delete a container resource in CREATE_FAILED state.
 https://bugs.launchpad.net/heat/+bug/1364041
docker plugin volumes_from parameter should be a list.

    <summary>I have been looking at both Docker and OpenStack recently. In my last post I talked a little about the Docker driver for Nova; in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking an in-depth look at the Docker plugin for Heat, which has been available since the Icehouse release but is surprisingly under-documented.
The release announcement on the Docker blog includes an example Heat template, but it is unfortunately grossly inaccurate and has led many people astray.</summary>
