    <summary>CircuitPython is &amp;ldquo;an education friendly open source derivative of MicroPython&amp;rdquo;. MicroPython is a port of Python to microcontroller environments; it can run on boards with very few resources such as the ESP8266. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started experimenting with CircuitPython on a Wemos D1 mini, which is a small form-factor ESP8266 board.
I had previously been using Mike Causer&amp;rsquo;s micropython-tm1637 for MicroPython to drive a 4 digit LED display. I was hoping to get the same code working under CircuitPython, but when I tried to build an image that included the tm1637 module I ran into:</summary>
