    <summary>A common problem for folks working with Docker is accessing resources which require authentication during the image build step. A particularly common use case is getting access to private git repositories using ssh key-based authentication. Until recently there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a great solution:
 you can embed secrets in your image, but now you can&amp;rsquo;t share the image with anybody. you can use build arguments, but this requires passing in an unenecrypted private key on the docker build command line, which is suboptimal for a number of reasons you can perform all the steps requiring authentication at runtime, but this can needlessly complicate your container startup process.</summary>
