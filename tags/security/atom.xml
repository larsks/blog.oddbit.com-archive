    <summary>Bitwarden is a password management service (like LastPass or 1Password). It&amp;rsquo;s unique in that it is built entirely on open source software. In addition to the the web UI and mobile apps that you would expect, Bitwarden also provides a command-line tool for interacting with the your password store.
At $WORK(-ish) we&amp;rsquo;re looking into Bitwarden because we want a password sharing and management solution that was better than dropping files into directories on remote hosts or sharing things over Slack.</summary>
