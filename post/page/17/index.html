    Update: This patch has been accepted into gPXE.
I just released a patch to gPXE that modifies the dhcp command so that it can iterate over multiple interfaces. The stock dhcp command only accepts a single interface as an argument, which can be a problem if you are trying to boot on a machine with multiple interfaces. The builtin autoboot commands attempts to resolve this, but is only useful if you expect to receive appropriate boot parameters from your dhcp server.

    There are many guides out there to help you configure your Linux system as an LDAP and Kerberos client to an Active Directory server. Most of these guides solve the problem of authentication by embedding a username and password into a configuration file somewhere on your system. While this works, it presents some problems:
 If you use a common account for authentication from all of your Linux systems, a compromise on one system means updating the configuration of all of your systems.

    I recently set up a git repository server (using gitosis and gitweb). Among the required features of the system was the ability to publish the git repository to a read-only Subversion repository. This sounds simple in principle but in practice proved to be a bit tricky.
Git makes an excellent Subversion client. You can use the git svn &hellip; series of commands to pull a remote Subversion repository into a local git working tree and then have all the local advantages of git forcing the central code repository to change version control software.

    Problem 1: Failover The problem Many applications only allow you to configure a single LDAP server. This can lead to unnecessary service outages if your directory service infrastructure is highly available (e.g., you are running Active Directory) and your application cannot take advantage of this fact.
A solution We can provide a level of redundancy by passing the LDAP connections through a load balancing proxy. While this makes the proxy a single point of failure, it is (a) a very simple tool and thus less prone to complex failure modes, (b) running on the same host as the web application, and &copy; is completely under our control.

    As part of a project I&rsquo;m working on I wanted to get a rough idea of the activity of the Apache virtual hosts on the system. I wasn&rsquo;t able to find exactly what I wanted, so I refreshed my memory of curses to bring you vhoststats.
This tools reads an Apache log file (with support for arbitrary formats) and generates a dynamic bar chart showing the activity (in number of requests and bytes transferred) of hosts on the system.

    This document provides an example of using OpenLDAP&rsquo;s meta backend to provide a unified view of two distinct LDAP directory trees. I was frustrated by the lack of simple examples available when I went looking for information on this topic, so this is my attempt to make life easier for the next person looking to do the same thing.
The particular use case that motiviated my interest in this topic was the need to configure web applications to (a) authenticate against an existing Active Directory server while (b) also allowing new accounts to be provisioned quickly and without granting any access in the AD environment.

    After encountering a number of problems trying to filter Blogger feeds by tag (using services like Feedrinse and Yahoo Pipes), I&rsquo;ve finally put together a solution that works:
 Shadow the feed with Feedburner. Enable the Convert Format Burner, and convert your feed to RSS 2.0. Use Yahoo Pipes to filter the feed (because Feedrinse seems to be broken).  This let me create a feed that excluded all my posts containing the fbpost tag, thus allowing me to avoid yet another postgasm in Facebook when adding new import URL to notes.

    The MBTA has a trial web service interface that provides access to realtime location information for select MBTA buses, as well as access to route information, arrival prediction, and other features. More information can be found here:

 The service is provided by NextBus, which specializes in real-time location information for public transit organizations. The API (sorry, PDF) is very simple and does not require any sort of advance registration.

    VNC clients use the RFB protocol to provide virtual display capabilities. The RFB protocol, as implemented by most clients, provides very poor authentication options. While passwords are not actually sent &ldquo;in the clear&rdquo;, it is possible to brute force them based on information available on the wire. The RFB 3.x protocol limits passwords to a maximum of eight characters, so the potential key space is relatively small.
It&rsquo;s possible to securely connect to a remote VNC server by tunneling your connection using ssh port forwarding (or setting up some sort of SSL proxy).
