    I&rsquo;m been writing a provisioning tool for OpenStack recently, and I&rsquo;ve put together a demo configuration that installs a simple cluster consisting of three backend nodes and a front-end http proxy. I needed a way for the backend servers to discover the ip address of the frontend server. Since in my target environment everything would be on the same layer-2 network segment, service discovery with multicast DNS (mDNS) seemed like the way to go.

    I needed to replace the native OpenJDK based Java VM with the Oracle Java distribution on one of our CentOS servers. In order to do it cleanly I wanted to set up the alternatives system to handle it, but it took a while to figure out the exact syntax.
For the record (and because I will probably forget):
alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/java/latest/bin/java 2000 \ --slave /usr/bin/keytool keytool /usr/java/latest/bin/keytool \ --slave /usr/bin/rmiregistry rmiregistry /usr/java/latest/bin/rmiregistry

    I recently embarked upon a quest to categorize a year&rsquo;s worth of trouble tickets (around 15000 documents total). We wanted to see what sort of things are generating the most work for our helpdesk staff so that we can identify areas in which improvements would have the biggest impact. One of my colleagues took a first pass at the data by manually categorizing the tickets based on their subject. This resulted in some useful data, but in the end just over 40% of the tickets are still uncategorized.

    Scriptogr.am has a very simple api that allows one to POST and DELETE articles. POSTing an article will place it in the appropriate Dropbox directory and make it available on your blog all in one step.
Here is how you could use this API via Curl:
curl \ -d app_key=$APP_KEY \ -d user_id=$USER_ID \ -d name=&quot;${title:-$1}&quot; \ --data-urlencode text@$tmpfile \ \ http://scriptogr.am/api/article/post/  This assumes that you&rsquo;ve registered for an application key and that you have configured the value into $APP_KEY and your Scriptogr.

    I ran into an odd problem the other day: I was testing out some configuration changes for a web application by dropping files into /tmp and pointing the application configuration at the appropriate directory. Everything worked out great when testing it by hand&hellip;but when starting up the httpd service, the application behaved as if it was unable to find any of the files in /tmp.
My first assumption was that had simply missed something obvious like file permissions or that I had a typo in my configuration, but after repeated checks and lots of testing it was obvious that something else was going on.

    I was looking for PowerShell solutions for generating a random password (in order to set the Administrator password on a Windows instance provisioned in OpenStack), and found several solutions using the GeneratePassword method of System.Web.Security.Membership (documentation here), along the lines of this:
Function New-RandomComplexPassword ($length=8) { $Assembly = Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Web $password = [System.Web.Security.Membership]::GeneratePassword($length,2) return $password }  While this works, I was unhappy with the generated passwords: they were difficult to type or transcribe because they make heavy use of punctuation.

    I&rsquo;ve recently been exploring the world of Windows scripting, and I ran into a small problem: I was running a script at system startup, and the script was running before the network interface (which was using DHCP) was configured.
There are a number of common solutions proposed to this problem:
  Just wait for some period of time.
This can work but it&rsquo;s ugly, and because it doesn&rsquo;t actually verify the network state it can result in things breaking if some problem prevents Windows from pulling a valid DHCP lease.
