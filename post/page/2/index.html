    I&rsquo;ve had my eye on the Vortex Core keyboard for a few months now, and this past week I finally broke down and bought one (with Cherry MX Brown switches). The Vortex Core is a 40% keyboard, which means it consists primarily of letter keys, a few lonely bits of punctuation, and several modifier keys to activate different layers on the keyboard.
  Physical impressions It&rsquo;s a really cute keyboard.

    At work we have a cluster of IBM Power 9 systems running OpenShift. The problem with this environment is that nobody runs Power 9 on their desktop, and Docker Hub only offers automatic build support for the x86 architecture. This means there&rsquo;s no convenient options for building Power 9 Docker images&hellip;or so I thought.
It turns out that Docker provides GitHub actions that make the process of producing multi-architecture images quite simple.

    This is part of a series of posts about my experience working with OpenShift and CNV. In this post, I&rsquo;ll look at how the recently released CNV 2.4 resolves some issues in managing virtual machines that are attached directly to local layer 2 networks
In an earlier post, I discussed some issues around the management of virtual machine MAC addresses in CNV 2.3: in particular, that virtual machines are assigned a random MAC address not just at creation time but every time they boot.

 TL;DR Overview Connectivity options Direct attachment Using an OpenShift Service  Exposing services on NodePorts Exposing services on cluster external IPso Exposing services using a LoadBalancer     TL;DR Networking seems to be a weak area for CNV right now.

In this post, I&rsquo;ll be taking a look at the installation experience, and in particular at how restrictions in our local environment interacted with the network requirements of the installer.

    The folks at Seeed Studio were kind enough to send me a Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino for review. That&rsquo;s a mouthful of a name for a compact little kit!
The Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino (henceforth &ldquo;the Kit&rdquo;, because ain&rsquo;t nobody got time to type that out more than a few times in a single article) is about 8.5 x 5 x 1 inches. Closed, you could fit two of them on a piece of 8.

    The folks at Seeed Studio have just released the Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino, and they asked if I would be willing to take a look at it in exchange for a free kit. At first glance it reminds me of the Radio Shack (remember when they were cool?) electronics kit I had when I was a kid &ndash; but somewhat more advanced. I&rsquo;m excited to take a closer look, but given shipping these days means it&rsquo;s probably a month away at least.

    Since we&rsquo;re all stuck in the house and working from home these days, I&rsquo;ve had to make some changes to my home office. One change in particular was requested by my wife, who now shares our rather small home office space with me: after a week or so of calls with me clattering away on my old Das Keyboard 3 Professional in the background, she asked if I could get something that was maybe a little bit quieter.

    We&rsquo;re all looking for ways to keep ourselves occupied these days, and for me that means leaping at the chance to turn a small problem into a slightly ridiculous electronics project. For reasons that I won&rsquo;t go into here I wanted to generate an alert when a certain WiFi BSSID becomes visible. A simple solution to this problem would have been a few lines of shell script to send me an email&hellip;but this article isn&rsquo;t about simple solutions!
