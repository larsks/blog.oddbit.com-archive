    In today&rsquo;s post, we look at KeyOxide, a service that allows you to cryptographically assert ownership of online resources using your GPG key. Some aspects of the service are less than obvious; in response to some questions I saw on Mastodon I though I would put together a short guide to making use of the service.
We&rsquo;re going to look at the following high-level tasks:

    Hello, future me. This is for you next time you want to do this.
When setting up the CI for a project I will sometimes end up with a tremendous clutter of workflow runs. Sometimes they have embarrassing mistakes. Who wants to show that to people? I was trying to figure out how to bulk delete workflow runs from the CLI, and I came up with something that works:
gh run list --json databaseId -q '.

    We are working with an application that produces resource utilization reports for clients of our OpenShift-based cloud environments. The developers working with the application have been reporting mysterious issues concerning connection timeouts between the application and the database (a MariaDB instance). For a long time we had only high-level verbal descriptions of the problem (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of connection timeouts!&quot;) and a variety of unsubstantiated theories (from multiple sources) about the cause.

    This post is mostly for myself: I find the Traefik documentation hard to navigate, so having figured this out in response to a question on Stack Overflow, I&rsquo;m putting it here to help it stick in my head.
The question asks essentially how to perform port-based routing of requests to containers, so that a request for http://example.com goes to one container while a request for http://example.com:9090 goes to a different container.

    I like to fiddle with Micropython, particularly on the Wemos D1 Mini, because these are such a neat form factor. Unfortunately, they have a cheap CH340 serial adapter on board, which means that from the perspective of Linux these devices are all functionally identical &ndash; there&rsquo;s no way to identify one device from another. This by itself would be a manageable problem, except that the device names assigned to these devices aren&rsquo;t constant: depending on the order in which they get plugged in (and the order in which they are detected at boot), a device might be /dev/ttyUSB0 one day and /dev/ttyUSB2 another day.

    At $JOB we maintain the configuration for our OpenShift clusters in a public git repository. Changes in the git repository are applied automatically using ArgoCD and Kustomize. This works great, but the public nature of the repository means we need to find a secure solution for managing secrets (such as passwords and other credentials necessary for authenticating to external services). In particular, we need a solution that permits our public repository to be the source of truth for our cluster configuration, without compromising our credentials.

    Red Hat&rsquo;s OpenShift Data Foundation (formerly &ldquo;OpenShift Container Storage&rdquo;, or &ldquo;OCS&rdquo;) allows you to either (a) automatically set up a Ceph cluster as an application running on your OpenShift cluster, or (b) connect your OpenShift cluster to an externally managed Ceph cluster. While setting up Ceph as an OpenShift application is a relatively polished experienced, connecting to an external cluster still has some rough edges.
NB I am not a Ceph expert.

    Kustomize is a tool for assembling Kubernetes manifests from a collection of files. We&rsquo;re making extensive use of Kustomize in the operate-first project. In order to keep secrets stored in our configuration repositories, we&rsquo;re using the KSOPS plugin, which enables Kustomize to use sops to encrypt/files using GPG.
In this post, I&rsquo;d like to walk through the steps necessary to get everything up and running.
Set up GPG We encrypt files using GPG, so the first step is making sure that you have a GPG keypair and that your public key is published where other people can find it.
