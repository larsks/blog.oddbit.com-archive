    The folks at Seeed Studio were kind enough to send me a Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino for review. That&rsquo;s a mouthful of a name for a compact little kit!
The Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino (henceforth &ldquo;the Kit&rdquo;, because ain&rsquo;t nobody got time to type that out more than a few times in a single article) is about 8.5 x 5 x 1 inches. Closed, you could fit two of them on a piece of 8.

    The folks at Seeed Studio have just released the Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino, and they asked if I would be willing to take a look at it in exchange for a free kit. At first glance it reminds me of the Radio Shack (remember when they were cool?) electronics kit I had when I was a kid &ndash; but somewhat more advanced. I&rsquo;m excited to take a closer look, but given shipping these days means it&rsquo;s probably a month away at least.

    Since we&rsquo;re all stuck in the house and working from home these days, I&rsquo;ve had to make some changes to my home office. One change in particular was requested by my wife, who now shares our rather small home office space with me: after a week or so of calls with me clattering away on my old Das Keyboard 3 Professional in the background, she asked if I could get something that was maybe a little bit quieter.

    We&rsquo;re all looking for ways to keep ourselves occupied these days, and for me that means leaping at the chance to turn a small problem into a slightly ridiculous electronics project. For reasons that I won&rsquo;t go into here I wanted to generate an alert when a certain WiFi BSSID becomes visible. A simple solution to this problem would have been a few lines of shell script to send me an email&hellip;but this article isn&rsquo;t about simple solutions!

    legendre on #raspbian asked:
 How can i config rasp lite to open a shell on the serial uart on boot? Params are 1200-8-N-1 Dont want login running, just straight to sh
 In this article, we&rsquo;ll walk through one way of implementing this configuration.
Activate the serial port Raspbian automatically starts a getty on the serial port if one is available. You should see an agetty process associated with your serial port when you run ps -ef.

    I recently acquired a managed switch for my home office in order to segment a few devices off onto their own isolated vlan. As part of this, I want to expose these vlans on my desktop using Open vSwitch (OVS), and I wanted to implement the configuration using NetworkManager rather than either relying on the legacy /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts scripts or rolling my own set of services. These are my notes in case I ever have to do this again.

    We&rsquo;ve had some wacky weather recently. In the space of a week, the temperature went from a high of about 75°F to a low around 15°F. This got me to thinking about what constitutes &ldquo;normal&rdquo; weather here in the Boston area, and in particular, how common it is to have a string of consecutive days in which the high temperature stays below freezing. While this was an interesting question in itself, it also seemed like a great opportunity to learn a little about Pandas, the Python data analysis framework.

    Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is combined with its documentation to form a single document. Tools are then used to extract the documentation for viewing or typesetting or to extract the program code so it can be compiled and/or run. While I have never been very enthusiastic about literate programming as a development methodology, I was recently inspired to explore these ideas as they relate to the sort of technical writing I do for this blog.

    Introduction A long time ago, I wrote an article all about OpenStack Neutron (which at that time was called Quantum). That served as an excellent reference for a number of years, but if you&rsquo;ve deployed a recent version of OpenStack you may have noticed that the network architecture looks completely different. The network namespaces previously used to implement routers and dhcp servers are gone (along with iptables rules and other features), and have been replaced by OVN (&ldquo;Open Virtual Network&rdquo;).

    I recently acquired my Technician amateur radio license, and like many folks my first radio purchase was a Baofeng UV-5R. Due to its low cost, this is a very popular radio, and there is excellent open source software available for programming it in the form of the CHIRP project. After futzing around with the UV-5R for a while, I wanted to get something a little nicer for use at home, so I purchased a Kenwood TM-V71A.
