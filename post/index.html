    Always work on a branch (never commit on master) When working with an upstream codebase, always make your changes on a feature branch rather than your local master branch. This will make it easier to keep your local master branch current with respect to upstream, and can help avoid situations in which you accidentally overwrite your local changes or introduce unnecessary merge commits into your history.
Rebase instead of merge If you need to incorporate changes from the upstream master branch in the feature branch on which you are currently doing, bring in those changes using git rebase rather than git merge.

    In this article, we will look at what is necessary to run OpenStack&rsquo;s Keystone service (and the requisite database server) in containers using Docker Compose.
Running MariaDB The standard mariadb docker image can be configured via a number of environment variables. It also benefits from persistent volume storage, since in most situations you don&rsquo;t want to lose your data when you remove a container. A simple docker command line for starting MariaDB might look something like:

    A year or so ago I was diagnosed with sleep apnea, and since them I&rsquo;ve been sleeping with a CPAP. This past weekend, I joined my daughter on a scout camping trip to a campground without readily accessible electricity. This would be the first time I found myself in this situation, and as the date approached, I realized I was going to have to build or buy some sort of battery solution for my CPAP.

    I recently answered a question from Harsha Nalore on StackOverflow that involved using Ansible to extract the output of a command sent to a BigIP device of some sort. My solution &ndash; which I claim to be functional, but probably not optimal &ndash; involved writing an Ansible filter module to parse the output. That filter made use of a complex-looking regular expression. Harsha asked for some details on that regular expression works, and the existing StackOverflow answer didn&rsquo;t really seem the write place for that: so, here we are.

    As long as I&rsquo;m switching site generators, it seems like a good idea to refresh the comment system as well. I&rsquo;ve been using Disqus for a while, since when I started it was one of the only games in town. There are now alternatives of different sorts, and one in particular caught my eye: Utterances uses GitHub issues for storing comments, which seems like a fantastic idea.
That means that comments will finally be stored in the same place as the blog content, which I think is a happy state of affairs.

    I often see questions from people who are attemping to perform complex text transformations in their Ansible playbooks. While I am a huge fan of Ansible, data transformation is not one of its strong points. For example, this past week someone asked a question on Stack Overflow in which they were attempting to convert the output of the keytool command into a list of dictionaries. The output of the keytool -list -v command looks something like this:

    A common problem for folks working with Docker is accessing resources which require authentication during the image build step. A particularly common use case is getting access to private git repositories using ssh key-based authentication. Until recently there hasn&rsquo;t been a great solution:
 you can embed secrets in your image, but now you can&rsquo;t share the image with anybody. you can use build arguments, but this requires passing in an unenecrypted private key on the docker build command line, which is suboptimal for a number of reasons you can perform all the steps requiring authentication at runtime, but this can needlessly complicate your container startup process.
