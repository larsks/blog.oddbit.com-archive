    In this post, we&rsquo;ll look at a method for building minimal Docker images for dynamically linked ELF binaries, and then at a tool for automating this process.
It is tempting, when creating a simple Docker image, to start with one of the images provided by the major distributions. For example, if you need an image that provides tcpdump for use on your Atomic host, you might do something like:
FROM fedora RUN yum -y install tcpdump  And while this will work, you end up consuming 250MB for tcpdump.

    I saw a request from a customer float by the other day regarding the ability to filter the XML used to create Nova instances in libvirt. The customer effectively wanted to blacklist a variety of devices (and device types). The consensus seems to be &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t do this right now and upstream is unlikely to accept patches that implement this behavior&rdquo;, but it sounded like an interesting problem, so&hellip;

    While working with Docker the other day, I ran into an undesirable interaction between Docker and systemd services that utilize the PrivateTmp directive.
The PrivateTmp directive, if true, &ldquo;sets up a new file system namespace for the executed processes and mounts private /tmp and /var/tmp directories inside it that is not shared by processes outside of the namespace&rdquo;. This is a great idea from a security perspective, but can cause some unanticipated consequences.

    I regularly use OpenStack on my laptop with libvirt as my hypervisor. I was interested in experimenting with recent versions of the nova-docker driver, but I didn&rsquo;t have a spare system available on which to run the driver, and I use my regular nova-compute service often enough that I didn&rsquo;t want to simply disable it temporarily in favor of nova-docker.
 NB As pointed out by gustavo in the comments, running two neutron-openvswitch-agents on the same host &ndash; as suggested in this article &ndash; is going to lead to nothing but sadness and doom.

Configuring serial console support In previous release of OpenStack, read-only access to the serial console of your servers was available through the os-getConsoleOutput server action (exposed via nova console-log on the command line).

    Setting the stage I ran into a problem earlier this week deploying RDO Icehouse under RHEL 6. My target systems were a set of libvirt guests deployed from the RHEL 6 KVM guest image, which includes cloud-init in order to support automatic configuration in cloud environments. I take advantage of this when using libvirt by attaching a configuration drive so that I can pass in ssh keys and a user-data script.

    Recently, I&rsquo;ve been playing around with Fedora Atomic and Kubernetes. I ran into a frustrating problem in which I would attempt to start a service from within a script launched by cloud-init, only to have have systemctl block indefinitely because the service I was attempting to start was dependent on cloud-init finishing first.
It turns out that systemctl has a flag meant exactly for this situation:
 --no-block Do not synchronously wait for the requested operation to finish.

    While experimenting with Fedora Atomic, I was looking for an elegant way to automatically deploy Atomic into an OpenStack environment and then automatically schedule some Docker containers on the Atomic host. This post describes my solution.
Like many other cloud-targeted distributions, Fedora Atomic runs cloud-init when the system boots. We can take advantage of this to configure the system at first boot by providing a user-data blob to Nova when we boot the instance.

    If you want to build a Windows image for use in your OpenStack environment, you can follow the example in the official documentation, or you can grab a Windows 2012r2 evaluation pre-built image from the nice folks at CloudBase.
The CloudBase-provided image is built using a set of scripts and configuration files that CloudBase has made available on GitHub.
The CloudBase repository is an excellent source of information, but I wanted to understand the process myself.
