    Because nobody asked for it, this is my opinion on the use of the MAINTAINER directive in your Dockerfiles.
The documentation says simply:
The MAINTAINER instruction allows you to set the Author field of the generated images.  Many people end up putting the name and email address of an actual person here. I think this is ultimately a bad idea, and does a disservice both to members of a project that produce Docker images and to people consuming those images.

    Most major distributions now provide &ldquo;cloud-enabled&rdquo; images designed for use in cloud environments like OpenStack and AWS. These images are usually differentiated by (a) being relatively small, and (b) running cloud-init at boot to perform initial system configuration tasks using metadata provided by the cloud environment.
Because of their small size and support for automatic configuration (including such useful tasks as provisioning ssh keys), these images are attractive for use outside of a cloud environment.

    I recently had the chance to help a colleague debug some problems in his OpenStack installation. The environment was unique because it was booting virtualized aarch64 instances, which at the time did not have any PCI bus support&hellip;which in turn precluded things like graphic consoles (i.e., VNC or SPICE consoles) for the Nova instances.
This post began life as an email summarizing the various configuration changes we made on the systems to get things up and running.

    This is another post that is primarily for my own benefit for the next time I forget how to do this.
I wanted to read routing information directly from /proc/net/route using bash, because you never know what may or may not be available in the minimal environment of a Docker container (for example, the iproute package is not installed by default in the Fedora Docker images). The contents of /proc/net/route looks something like:

You can pass this output to graphviz to create visualizations of your Pacemaker resource constraints.
The graph-constraints.py script in that repository consumes the output of cibadmin -Q and can produce output for either start constraints (-S, the default) or colocation constraints (-C).

Check if there are any inactive resources pcs status xml | xmllint --xpath '//resource[@active=&quot;false&quot;]' - &gt;&amp;/dev/null &amp;&amp; echo &quot;There are inactive resources&quot;  This selects any resource (//resource) in the output of pcs status xml that has the attribute active set to false.

    In some ways, the most exciting thing about Docker isn&rsquo;t the ability to start containers. That&rsquo;s been around for a long time in various forms, such as LXC or OpenVZ. What Docker brought to the party was a convenient method of building and distributing the filesystems necessary for running containers. Suddenly, it was easy to build a containerized service and to share it with other people.
I was taking a closer at the systemd-nspawn command, which it seems has been developing it&rsquo;s own set of container-related superpowers recently, including a number of options for setting up the network environment of a container.

    This is a long-form response to this question, and describes how to get the nova-docker driver up running with devstack under Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty). I wrote a similar post for Fedora 21, although that one was using the RDO Juno packages, while this one is using devstack and the upstream sources.
Getting started We&rsquo;ll be using the Ubuntu 14.04 cloud image (because my test environment runs on OpenStack).
